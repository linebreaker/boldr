          This proposal introduces an Observable type to the ECMAScript standard library. The Observable type can be used to model push-based data sources such as DOM events, timer intervals, and sockets.

          The iterator interface (introduced in ECMAScript 2015) is a sequential data access protocol which enables the development of generic and composable data consumers and transformers. Their primary interface is a next() method which returns a value, done tuple, where done is a boolean indicating whether the end of the iterator has been reached, and value is the yielded value in the sequence.

          In ECMAScript, a realm consists of a global object and an associated set of primordial objects -- mutable objects like Array.prototype that must exist before any code runs. Objects within a realm implicitly share these primordials and can therefore easily disrupt each other by primordial poisoning -- modifying these objects to behave badly. This disruption may happen accidentally or maliciously. Today, in the browser, realms can be created via same origin iframes.
